Hello madam, sir,

To launch this program in Eclipse, we need the library SwingStates and add it to your Java project. In Eclipse: Right click on the Project> Java Build Path> Libraries> Add External JARs.

We must add the two folders "rsc" and "resources" in your project too, in the same directory of src folder. I defined the gestures in the rsc/vocabulaire.cl file.

To launch the jar file in the folder original, because it needs the icons in folder resources.


Thank you
